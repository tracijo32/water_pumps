Project for Data Driven competition -- "Pump It Up: Data Mining the Water Table"

Here's my work for the machine learning competition for predicting the status of water pumps in Tanzania. I used a Gradient Boosting Algorithm to achieve a 79% accuracy on the blind test data for the competition, placing me at ~1100/5860 place (81st percentile) amongst other competitors.
